        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 13, 2025</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how MIRA (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information in the MIRA mobile application
            and on our website.
            We designed MIRA with privacy in mind.
        </p>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Data You Create:</strong> Your video entries and mood logs are stored on your device by
                default. We do not receive them unless you explicitly choose a cloud sync option that we provide.</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> We may collect anonymous diagnostics and crash reports to improve
                stability. This can be controlled in system settings where applicable.</li>
            <li><strong>Website Analytics:</strong> If enabled on our site, we may use privacy-friendly analytics to
                understand general traffic. No personal profiles are built.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and improve MIRA features</li>
            <li>Fix bugs and enhance performance</li>
            <li>Communicate important updates and support responses</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited information with service providers who help us
            operate the app and website. These providers are bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations.
        </p>

        <h2>Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            Your entries remain on your device unless you choose to back up or sync with a cloud service. We use
            reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data, but no method is perfectly secure.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can delete entries from within the app.</li>
            <li>You can contact us to request deletion of support communications that include your personal information.
            </li>
            <li>You can disable analytics where available.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            MIRA is not intended for children under the age of 13. If you believe a child has provided us personal data,
            contact us and we will address it promptly.
        </p>

        <h2>Region-specific Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export your personal data.
            Contact us to exercise these rights.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>

            this page.
